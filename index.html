                            <p>Originally written for the Google Wifi Help Center, this article describes the DNS rebinding defenses used by that device. It demonstrates taking a very technical feature and documenting it in a way that’s intelligible to an average user, while still including enough information for more advanced ones.</p>

                                <p>Project Galahad is an internal support article with supporting email/survey templates for a customer re-engagement process. Once a customer is contacted using the email and survey invites, support agents can use the article to guide the interaction. The product in question is the fictional Alfred smart home assistant by XS Tech.</p>

                            <p>This external support article was originally two different articles for two different kind of device resets. When combined with vague and variable terminology, it created substantial confusion with customers and support agents alike. I proceeded to write a new, consolidated article which clearly defined the terminology, use cases, and instructions for each.</p>                        </div>

                            <p>A Bay Area native, I’ve spent the last 5 years providing writing support for Google projects as a vendor-based contractor. Having done technical writing, customer support documentation, and even social media based customer engagement, I’ve gained experience writing in multiple voices and under vastly different constraints. I’m currently writing for the external Pixelbook and Pixel Slate Help Centers, as well as for a new, UI-centric product support channel.</p>    
                            <p>Much of my work has been proprietary, and geared towards either internal support documentation or confidential products. However, the samples presented here are safe for release, and demonstrate different areas of aptitude: feature documentation, external support writing, internal customer support processes, and markdown-based technical documentation.</p>
